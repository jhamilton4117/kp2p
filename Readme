And To use this Script you need to do somethings first 
You need to install Termux 
1. Test your device supports hostmode or not by connecting other mobile to your mobile it should detect.
2. If its working good then next you need make adb work in your mobile

4. Then check adb devices if device Shown up you can proceed.
5. And Next change the Path in script ,In my Mobile i used the path /sdcard/Lab/kp2p so change the path to yours.
